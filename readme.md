JavaScript: Password Generator

Subject Task:

Create a Password Generator application

based on the following Acceptance Criterias:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password

WHEN I click the button to generate a password

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

WHEN prompted for password criteria

THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password

THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password

THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters 

WHEN I answer each prompt

THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

WHEN all prompts are answered

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

WHEN the password is generated

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page




The following image shows the web application's appearance and object's functionality:

What I learned,

In this assignment I learned about for looping, and the techniques of creating functions for prompts and alerts. 

I learned about the preventDefault () method that if an event is cancelable, cancels the event.  The default action

that belongs to the event will not occur. I've learned about breaking codes and then correcting them to be sure they run 

properly.

For the password, I added an additional set of variables, 'emoji' characters to the selection of characters. 

The results were complex characters generated, rather than emojis.  This is something I do not understand how to correct.

I learned it could be that the type Unicode of emoji is not recognized therefore replacing the emoji with 

a replacement 'ï¿½' character. The character is used to indicate problems when a system is 

unable to render a stream of data to a correct symbol.  This problem cannot be corrected until I can find a solution.  

URL of the deployed application and URL of the GitHub repository are submitted.
