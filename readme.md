## What I learned,

In this assignment I learned about for looping, and the techniques of creating functions for prompts and alerts. 

I learned about the preventDefault () method that if an event is cancelable, cancels the event.  The default action

that belongs to the event will not occur. I've learned about breaking codes and then correcting them to be sure they run 

properly.

For the password, I added an additional set of variables, 'emoji' characters to the selection of characters. 

The results were complex characters generated, rather than emojis.  This is something I do not understand how to correct.

I learned it could be that the type Unicode of emoji is not recognized therefore replacing the emoji with 

a replacement 'ï¿½' character. The character is used to indicate problems when a system is 

unable to render a stream of data to a correct symbol.  This problem cannot be corrected until I can find a solution.
